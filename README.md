## Note

This server uses Alpaca's paper trading by default. To use real money trading, change `paper=True` to `paper=False` in the `TradingClient` initialization.

## Security Notice

This MCP server will have access to your Alpaca account and can place real trades. Always review what Claude is suggesting before approving any trades. This is especially important for option trading, which involves more complex strategies and higher risk.
