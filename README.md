```

Or use a module invocation:

```bash
python -m alpaca_mcp_server
```

### Claude for Desktop Configuration

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Navigate to: `Settings ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Edit Config`
3. Update your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpaca": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/alpaca_mcp_server.py"
      ],

## API Key Configuration for Live Trading

This MCP server connects to Alpaca's **paper trading API** by default for safe testing.
To enable **live trading with real funds**, update the following configuration files:

### üîê Set Your API Credentials in Two Places:

1. **Claude for Desktop Configuration**

   In `claude_desktop_config.json`, provide your keys for your live account as environment variables:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "alpaca": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": [
           "/path/to/alpaca_mcp_server.py"
         ],
         "env": {
           "API_KEY_ID": "your_alpaca_live_account_api_key",
           "API_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_live_account_secret_key"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **`.env` in the project directory**

   ```python
   API_KEY = "your_alpaca_live_account_api_key"
   API_SECRET = "your_alpaca_live_account_secret_key"
   PAPER = False
   ```
